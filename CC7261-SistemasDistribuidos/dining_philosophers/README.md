Runs only on windows.

To compile with g++ on windows do: ```g++ main.cpp implementations/*.cpp -o dining_philosophers -std=c++11```

- *Disclaimer:* Due to asynchronous operations, the visual log may seem bugged, but it's only a visual effect, the number of forks at the simulation is always the same as the number of philosophers
